# **Delhi's Daily Climate Time Series Data**
*Sangita Das*

### **Introduction**
This project focuses on analyzing Delhi's daily climate data spanning from January 1st, 2013, to April 24th, 2017. Delhi, as one of the world's most populous and rapidly growing cities, experiences significant climate challenges with implications for public health, urban planning, and sustainability. By studying detailed weather patterns during this four-year period, this project aims to uncover trends and insights that can inform decision-making on climate resilience and infrastructure planning.


### **Objectives**
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Understand Climate Trends**: Analyze the patterns in Delhi's climate data over time to identify significant trends in weather conditions.
2. **Predict Daily Temperatures**: Use meteorological features like humidity, wind speed, and pressure to predict daily mean temperatures.
3. **Model Comparison**: Compare different machine learning models to identify the best-performing model for temperature prediction.


### **Data Overview**
The dataset includes daily meteorological data with the following key features:

| **Feature**     | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `meantemp`       | Mean temperature averaged across multiple 3-hour intervals in a day.           |
| `humidity`       | Daily humidity value in grams of water vapor per cubic meter of air.           |
| `wind_speed`     | Wind speed measured in kilometers per hour (kmph).                             |
| `meanpressure`   | Daily atmospheric pressure reading measured in atm.                            |

### **Data Source**
The weather data has been sourced from the **Weather Underground API**, a reliable provider of daily weather observations. This dataset is publicly available on **Kaggle** and can be accessed through the following links:

- **[Train Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data/data?select=DailyDelhiClimateTrain.csv)**: Contains training data for the model.
- **[Test Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data/data?select=DailyDelhiClimateTest.csv)**: Contains test data for validation.

### **Project Highlights**
- **Time Series Analysis**: Explore temporal trends in Delhi's weather, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Employ various models to predict temperatures and compare their performance.
